## ✝️ Faith Meets Tech

I'm especially interested in building and contributing to **solutions that empower churches** to use technology to **enhance and simplify their daily services** — from administration to worship, outreach, and beyond.

## 🙌 Let's Build Together

If you're working on a project that helps churches or ministries thrive through tech, I'd love to hear about it and possibly collaborate!

_Thanks for stopping by! May your code be clean and your purpose clear._ ✨
